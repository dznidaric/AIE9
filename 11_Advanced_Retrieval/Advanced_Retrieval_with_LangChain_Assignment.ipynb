    "- Understand and implement multiple retrieval strategies for RAG\n",
    "- Compare naive, BM25, multi-query, parent-document, contextual compression, ensemble, and semantic chunking approaches\n",
    "- Build RAG chains over a health and wellness knowledge base using LangChain and QDrant\n",

Hold for 10 seconds and repeat 8-12 times.\\n\\n- Partial Crunches: Lie on your back with knees bent, cross arms over your chest, tighten your stomach muscles, and lift your shoulders off the floor briefly before lowering. Aim for 8-12 repetitions.\\n\\n- Knee-to-Chest Stretch: Lie on your back, pull one knee toward your chest while keeping the other foot flat on the ground.

    "\n",
    "1. We split the full document into large \"parent\" chunks (e.g. 2000 characters).\n",
    "2. Each parent chunk is further split into smaller \"child\" chunks (e.g. 400 characters).\n",
    "3. The child chunks are stored in a VectorStore, while the parent chunks are stored in an in-memory docstore.\n",
    "4. When we query our Retriever, we do a similarity search comparing our query vector to the child chunks.\n",
    "5. Instead of returning the child chunks, we return their associated parent chunks.\n",

    "- **Return** big chunks (richer surrounding context)\n",

Adequate sleep (7-9 hours per night) helps maintain physical health, mental well-being, and proper immune function. Poor sleep or disruptions in sleep cycles can lead to issues such as fatigue, headaches, weakened immune response, and impaired mental health. Good sleep hygiene practices and creating an optimal sleep environment are important for ensuring restful sleep and promoting overall wellness.'"

    "### ❓ Question #3:\n",
    "\n",
    "If sentences are short and highly repetitive (e.g., FAQs), how might semantic chunking behave, and how would you adjust the algorithm?\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "If sentences are short and highly repetitive, semantic chunking may behave poorly because many adjacent sentences will have very similar embeddings. This can cause the algorithm to merge too many Q/A items into large chunks, reducing retrieval precision (the retriever then returns a big chunk with multiple unrelated FAQs).\n",
    "\n",
    "To adjust, I would:\n",
    "- Lower the chunk-size ceiling (max sentences/tokens per chunk), based on the average faq size\n",
    "- Add structural split rules (eg., split on “Q:” / “A:” markers and/or blank lines) before applying semantic similarity\n",
    "- Use a stricter threshold or different methods, like gradient, to detect real topic shifts rather than small similarity changes\n",
    "- Embed Q/A pairs as atomic units (treat each FAQ entry as one document) instead of sentence-level chunking"
